# Abstract

Network security is a critical concern in today's interconnected world. Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in identifying suspicious or malicious activities within network traffic. In this study, I focus on leveraging the **UNSW-NB15** dataset - a comprehensive collection of network traffic data - to enhance the understanding of network anomalies.

__Research objectives__:

* **Dataset Exploration** - examin UNSW-NB15 dataset, it's features, structure, etc.
* **Feature Engineering** - extract relevant features and transform them into suitable format for ML algorithms
* **Model Selection and Evaluation** - explore various ML techniques, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGB Classifier, etc.
* **Performance Metrics** - evaluate model performance using metircs like precision, recall, F1-score AUC-ROC.

# Dataset

In this work, we are using **UNSW-NB15** dataset, which can be found [here](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset).
UNSW-NB15 dataset is a comprehensive benchmark dataset for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). 
The dataset was introduced by the Dr. Nour Moustafa and Jilly Slay, researchers from University of New South Wales (UNSW).
